    Compute the infinite sum of 2^{-n} starting from n = 0, truncating
    at n = N, returning the value of 2^{-n} and the truncated sum.

    Parameters
    ----------

    N : int
        Positive integer, giving the number of terms in the sum

    Returns
    -------

    limit : float
        The value of 2^{-N}
    sumseq : float
        The value of the truncated sum

    Notes
    -----

    The limiting value should be zero, and the value of the sum should
    converge to 2.
